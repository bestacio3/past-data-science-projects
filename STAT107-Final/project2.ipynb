    "Baseball is my favorite sport, and has been for my entire life; I played baseball for twelve years, visited nine different MLB stadiums, and even wrote my college essays about baseball. I've always been fascinated by baseball stats and analytics (I'd love to work in baseball analytics someday), so what better opportunity to explore that passion than this project? In this project, I'll be using Baseball Reference's 2024 standard batting stats dataset to analyze trends and answer questions about baseball.\n",

    "We now have the 2024 batting stats of every single MLB player who entered the lineup at any point during the season. Before we do anything with this data, there's a few issues with this dataset that I'd like to fix first:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I want to primarily look at the stats of ***position players***, but this dataset also includes any ***pitchers*** that may have entered the lineup as well. Since pitchers are generally not good at hitting (as that's not their primary job) and many of them don't have plate appearances anyways, I'll remove them from the dataset. This can be done by getting rid of the rows that contain only a \"1\", \"/1\", or \"1/H\" in the \"Pos\" column.\n",
    "- ***Players with very few plate appearances*** may end up skewing our data, since many of our stats are rate-based and their small sample sizes could result in extremely high or low rates. To combat this, I'll get rid of all players with less than 50 plate appearances.\n",
    "- ***Players who played for multiple teams*** (i.e. got traded or released midseason) have a row for each team they played on as well as a cumulative row; for my purposes, I'll get rid of the cumulative row and keep the individual team rows by getting rid of the rows where the \"Team\" column is \"2TM\", \"3TM\", or \"4TM\".\n",
    "- There's a few ***columns that aren't particularly useful***, such as \"Rk\", \"Player-additional\", and certain stats that even I'm not familiar with, so we'll drop these columns."

    "Baseball Reference defines the scale of WAR as:\n",
    "- 8+: MVP Quality\n",
    "- 5+: All-Star Quality\n",
    "- 2+: Starter\n",
    "- 0-2: Reserve\n",
    "- <0: Replacement Level\n",
    "\n",
    "This generally lines up with the histogram. The histogram is right skewed, showing that there are very few elite MVP-level and All-Star players, a decent amount of starters, and a surplus of reserve players. It also makes sense that there is a sharp drop-off of players as you get into negative WAR numbers, as most players that are bad enough to have negative WARs can be easily replaced by a better player.\n",

    "Predicting player performance is a real use of baseball analytics; what if we try to find the \"hidden gems\" of baseball by finding players that would have been really good if they had more playing time? To do this, we could take a look at existing rate stats as well as explore turning cumulative stats into rate stats, and then extrapolating these over a full season.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***What's the most important tool for winning: contact, power, or speed?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously a well-balanced offense is the key to a strong team, but which of these three correlates best with winning teams? To do this, we'll have to create a new DataFrame containing team statistics and records. Additionally, we'll need to find the best stats to quantify pure contact, power, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Who should have been an All-Star this year that wasn't? Who was an All-Star that shouldn't have been?***\n",
    "\n",
    "This one's pretty self-explanatory; we can find who the best offensive performers were that weren't All-Stars and the worst offensive performers who were All-Stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Can we predict WAR based on offensive statistics? Can we use the difference between predicted WAR and actual WAR to predict a player's defensive abilities?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we saw that WAR and OPS are heavily correlated, we can try to predict a player's WAR by using their offensive statistics (both rate and cumulative). Building off of this, since WAR _also_ takes defense into account, can we separate good from bad defenders using the difference between our offensive model and their actual WAR?\n",

Because of this, we might find that slower players have higher successful steal rates than faster players.

    "To answer the first part of this question, we'll make another multiple linear regression model, this time predicting individual player WAR. We already saw in section 3 that ***OPS and WAR have a strong correlation***, so we'll use ***OPS*** as the main predictive variable for offensive production in our model. Another stat we'll factor in is ***plate appearances***, as WAR is a cumulative stat so we need some way to account for how much a player played during the season. We'll also use ***walks, hits,*** and ***home runs*** as general cumulative offensive stats as well, and also ***stolen bases*** to account for baserunning value."

    "Time to visualize this data to help us answer both parts of our question! To do this, I'll create a scatter plot of the data, with the x-axis being our model's predicted WAR and the y-axis being the player's actual WAR. I'll also add some extra features to this plot to help visualize this data. First, I'll graph the line y=x on this plot to ***show where predicted WAR is equal to actual WAR***. This way, we can easily look at the plot and see where our model underestimated WAR (points above the line) and overestimated WAR (points below the line). Additionally, we'll finally make use of the Awards column in our dataset. The ***Gold Glove*** is an award given out to the best defensive player at each position in each league. I'll color the points representing 2024 Gold Glove winners ***gold***. Since we based our model purely off of offensive stats and WAR also takes into account defense, we want to see if our model ***underestimated WAR for good defensive players***."

    "Overall, it looks like our model is pretty good at predicting WAR! Visually, we can see that the points are generally close to the line where predicted WAR is equal to actual WAR, meaning that error is generally small. This is backed up by the ***relatively low average absolute error*** and a ***correlation coefficient of .885*** between WAR and Predicted WAR, which is close to 1 indicating a very close correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for whether or not we can use the error of our model to predict defensive performance, we have mixed results. While all of the Gold Glove recipients (colored in gold) are either above the line or right on it, only 4 of the top 20 prediction errors recieved a Gold Glove. Whether this is a shortcoming of our model or a statement on how Gold Gloves are chosen cannot be determined without looking at actual defensive metrics, which we don't have in our dataset. However, while we can't really determine the degree to which a player is a good or bad defender, it seems we can generally say that ***good defenders are above the line and bad defenders are below it***."

    "# Section 7: Overall Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this has been a very successful project! Working with ***Baseball-Reference's 2024 MLB Standard Batting*** dataset, we started by ***cleaning the data***, getting rid of unwanted players that skew the data and unnecessary columns. From there, we ***analyzed initial trends in the data*** such as the league average slash line, distribution of WAR across the league, and relationship between WAR and OPS. We then ***looked deeper into the data using machine learning models***. Using ***multiple linear regression***, we created separate models based on power, speed, and contact to predict team wins and found that, with an average absolute error of 6.28, ***power was the most important offensive attribute*** over contact and speed, with average absolute errors of 6.77 and 7.24, respectively. Finally, once again using multiple linear regression, we created a very reliable (low average absolute error of .612, strong correlation coefficient of .885 between actual and predicted WAR) model to ***predict WAR using offensive statistics***. By seeing how our model performed on Gold Glove award recipients, we came to the conclusion that ***our model can be used to separate good defenders from bad defenders*** based on if it underestimated or overestimated players' actual WAR.\n",
